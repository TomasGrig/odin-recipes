<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a taco spaghetti bake recipe that I came up with in the spur of the moment. My family, especially my 2-year-old, loved it! Very kid-friendly. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and shredded lettuce, if desired.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
    <li>¾ cup water</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>
    <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1 cup tortilla chips, crushed</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir in taco seasoning and water; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add corn and taco sauce; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Combine cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl until evenly mixed. Spread mixture over spaghetti. Spread beef mixture over sour cream mixture and top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
